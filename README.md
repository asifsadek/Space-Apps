### Primary Asteroid Types ###
1. **C-type** (most common) asteroids have a high abundance of water which is not currently of use for mining but could be used in an exploration effort beyond the asteroid. Mission costs could be reduced by using the available water from the asteroid. C-type asteroids also have a lot of organic carbon, phosphorus, and other key ingredients for fertilizer which could be used to grow food.
2. **S-type** carry little water but look more attractive because they contain numerous metals including: nickel, cobalt and more valuable metals such as gold, platinum and rhodium. A small 10-meter S-type asteroid contains about 1,433,000 pounds of metal with 110 pounds in the form of rare metals like platinum and gold.
3. **M-type** asteroids are rare but contain up to 10 times more metal than S-types

3. We've detected a 2km wide asteroid hurtling towards earch at 50,000km/h! If we don't do something fast this asteroid will surely wipe out all life on earth!
4. It's up to you to save the planet, are you up to the task?
5. To sweeten the deal, we're prepared to let you keep any material that you find along the way.
